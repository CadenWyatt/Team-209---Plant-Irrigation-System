# Team-209---Plant-Irrigation-System
This Project is a system that will monitor the temperature and work based on a clock to keep a plant watered. The design includes a temperature sensor for monitoring as stated previously, an analog sensor built to weigh the system, and a hydraulic pump to water. In additon, the system includes a wifi enabled chip to communicate with the users phone to provide helpful information as well as provide the use with control over the system itself. The design revolves around a Mircochip PIC microcontroller and is implemented using the manufacturers design software.
